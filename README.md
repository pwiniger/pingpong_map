Plot ping pong tables from openstreetmap in an interactive map of ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The base Binder image contains no extra dependencies, so be as
explicit as possible in defining the packages that you need. This includes
specifying explict versions wherever possible.
